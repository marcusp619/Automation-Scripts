# Automation-Scripts
Includes scripts that I wrote to automate some tasks for me

- [MemeBot](MemeBot):
  - Crawls 'iFunny' meme webpage, downloads newly featured memes
  and randomly sends a few memes to my slack channel
  
- [DownloadSongs](DownloadSongs):
  - Parses through my youtube playlist and fetches list of my newly added songs 
  - Downloads those songs and adds them to my cache file to they don't get downloaded again
  - Transfer those MP3 files to a separate folder that is tracked my 'Google Play Music'
  - 'Google Play Music' then syncs those songs to my phone and downloads them for offline playback
